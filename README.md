## HTML
HTML is the acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a form of programming language that is used to make web pages on the internet viewable. So it can be said that it is because of HTML that web pages are interesting to look at, but the importance of HTML is often taken for granted.

### Learning
#### Why??
If you dont learn HTML, you have to either be content with what the editor gives you or find someone who knows HTML and pay them for their HTML coding services. The best thing to do is to learn HTML, so that you can create the perfect web page for yourself, without having to pay others for it.

#### What??
HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:
